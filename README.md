Let's get started!  On the right hand side of the repository, you will find a button
that will allow you to clone or download this repo to your computer.  Once you have done so,
open the folder where you saved the repository, and look for the file named index.html.

Once you have located this file, you will want to right click on index.html and look for the option that is called, "open with".  Whenever you highlight this option, you will be given the
opportunity to open index.html in the browser of your own choice.  Once you have opened the file, you will see the feed reader, and if you scroll to the very bottom of the page, you will see the
results of the various tests that have been performed on the project using the Jasmine testing
suite.
